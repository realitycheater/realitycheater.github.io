        <p>It’s a Thursday afternoon, and I’m very, very bored.</p>
        <p>Work has been very slow lately, with the last project mostly dealt with aside from a few bits and pieces, I’ve been assigned to work on a large project for the airport, dealing with other airlines and incorporating them into our system. This type of work is always very slow - most of it from waiting, coordinating within such a complex system always takes time, whether from the airlines or from other devs, the actual development work itself is also shockingly simple, so, I have a lot of time on my hands, chatting online, reading books, and having the rare opportunity to just… think.</p>
        <p>I haven’t written anything in a while, at least nothing about myself. It’s not that there is nothing to write about (if anything it would be the opposite), but they just did not feel particularly significant, that if I did write about them, whatever came out wouldn’t be worth reading. But I think enough things have happened that they are at least worth jotting down somewhere, just so I can look back on them somewhere down the line, to remember how these events felt.</p>
        <p>I haven’t written anything in a while, not that there is nothing to write about, but because they don’t feel particularly significant, or that if I do write about them, it wouldn’t be something worth reading. But I think I’ve had enough things happen recently that they are at least worth jotting down somewhere, just so I can look back on things somewhere down the line, to remember how they felt.</p>
        <p>Back in July, I tried to quit my job.</p>
        <p>After a handsome bonus that surpassed even my overzealous expectations, I decided that I had enough, and wrote my own resignation, and mustered up the courage for the awkward confrontation over the phone. There were a lot of reasons to quit: The pay was bad, I was tired of being a solo developer, and I had no interest in taking 90 minute commutes to the airport.</p>
        <p>At least, these were the reasons I told my boss, I had no doubt these were valid, but deep down, I did not think they were root causes - I was just burnt out, and wanted a change, any kind of change in the scenery. Of course, the extra money I would most certainly get from a new job would be much welcomed.</p>
        <p>Over the phone, my boss, kind as always, was quick to have me name a price.</p>
        <p>“How much do you want?”</p>
        <p>Feeling a random surge of confidence:</p>
        <p>“15-20%”</p>
        <p>It was a high ask, not ludicrous, but considering the promotion, raise, and bonus I got in the past three months, I intended to make things at least a little hard for them. I expected a swift reply from HR, either telling me to fuck off, or worse, offer a measly raise in the single digits, at which point I would tell them the same thing, and hit the bread line.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for my plans, they… simply gave me what I asked for, HR pleaded with me to not quit in an admittedly bad market, and after discussing with friends and family, I took the counter-offer. I was still thinking about quitting, but the extra money and knowledge that I will be exempt from working on site at the airport made it much harder. Regardless, now I make a respectable wage that a 24 year old can be content with.</p>
        <p>The whole ordeal was mostly stressful, but it also gave me a strange feeling that I was not familiar with: discomfort.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I had a lot of freedom (maybe even too much), having free reign on making all types of decisions - school subjects, majors, careers, and everything in between. I remember telling my parents that I was no longer interested in piano classes, and they… simply listened to the 8 year old and let me stop, a rare thing to do in Asia.</p>
        <p>At the time, it felt easy to make those decisions, because I was simply doing what felt right, of course, I was never always right - my decision to give up art despite a promising early career still haunts me to this day. But at least I was able to go and say “This is what I want”, and actually mean it, despite the disapproval from the adults around me, and despite coming to regret the outcomes.</p>
        <p>When I was 18, I received my grades in the public exams. I excelled in both English and History… and almost failed Chinese. It was clear where my talents were, and no one would blame me for continuing my studies in the Arts. My teachers offered me different paths: My English teacher, a nice lady who tolerated me reading novels in her class for three entire years, suggested I become a teacher (I never understood why until years later.), my History teacher, impressed with me topping the class, recommended History. </p>
        <p>I respected them greatly, and yet I still told them I wanted to pursue software development instead, knowing that while my family is not exactly poor, we were not so well-off that I could throw away four years of my life buried under books and come out the other side making close to nothing - even if I might’ve liked those books. I most likely disappointed them, but I was confident, feeling almost smug as I told them “I want to get into software so I can make money.”, the memories of those words came back to me as I wrote my resignation - It was a  simple letter, just a couple dozen words outlining my last day at work, along with some corporate platitudes. It could not have taken more than five minutes to write, but each word I typed felt heavy and unsure, those five minutes felt like an hour. All of a sudden, I realized if I do quit, I face all the ramifications, both good and bad. </p>
        <p>This was obvious, of course I face the consequences for the things that I do, but this time felt different. I hated work: The pay sucked, the projects were boring and most people I encountered at work seemed to be kept alive by miracles, at times it was soul-destroying to clock in and spend all day angry at other people’s mistakes, but as I spent those 5 minutes typing my resignation, I lost that confidence, that conviction that I used to have: I remember it also took only 5 minutes for me to decide on the subjects I took during my high school years, the ramifications of that was massive - it influenced my university options, and in turn that my career. At the time however, I felt a sense of certainty in my choice, despite the questions from the teachers I had, I was so convinced that they knew they had no chance of changing my mind.</p>
        <p>While 24 is still young… mostly, I’m no longer the same carefree (and overweight) child that I used to be, while it is MY resignation, my decision still affects those around me. My mom recently switched jobs, taking a pay cut in the process. I also have to face the reality that my parents are both hitting the age where the medical bills start rolling in. While we aren’t in any immediate financial danger, it is still irresponsible for me to quit on the spot without a second job lined up. Some of you may say these are perfectly valid concerns, they most certainly are, but it’s precisely this validity that is discomforting for me, that loss of naivety that I lament.</p>
        <p>Growing up, the path forward was always clear: finish the grade and start the next one, studying this course so you can study another one, well-defined, rigid, goals to guide you through life, like steps on a stair. Now, there’s just… general, vague things like “Be a good son”, “Be a trusted friend”, “Advance in your career”, each with a million different ways to achieve. On one hand, it’s freeing - I can do whatever I want, but on the other hand, it’s suffocating because you feel, and perhaps are, lost with so many “legitimate” concerns.</p>
        <p>I am very aware that it’s a massive privilege to even have these problems, that I’m beyond lucky to have this much good in my life - a cushy job, mild online success, and a recent trip to Korea made me realize I did not completely miss out on my youth… in more ways than one, but I won’t talk about that here. However, the uncertainty of the future still lingers in my mind, even as I’m watching the sunset and sipping a beer on a beach in Jeju, surrounded by friends. </p>
        <p>It’s easy to say something like “just live in the moment”, but perhaps the true mark (or curse) of becoming an adult is to know that is simply not a good way to live, that some effort must be put in planning ahead, that some things must be thought through first… Or is this the true curse? To think they HAVE to be thought through? I don’t know. Regardless, the consequences make themselves apparent - that third can of beer you had on an empty stomach comes back for you as you hug the toilet bowl, don’t ask me how I know that.</p>
        <p>Like a lot of my previous posts, I hoped to reach some conclusion as I finished up, to find something satisfying that answers all the anxieties I have, but after typing all these words… I have nothing, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to answer these questions, right now, these feel like things I’ll just have to live with, and occasionally ponder about.</p>
        <p>Oddly, these questions do not discomfort me as much, these past weeks, I feel a certain type of serenity, just enjoying my daily routine, of course, this is no peak, I know there is much more to be experienced out there, but for now, I am somehow content with where I am in life, something that I’ve never experienced.</p>
        <p>We’ll see what happens next.</p>
